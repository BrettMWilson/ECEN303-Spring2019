Students:

To help you develop better insight into applied probability, this course will feature (optional) Python programming challenges. The main site for the class is a Git repository hosted on GitHub:

* https://github.com/CourseReps/ECEN303-Spring2019

On this site, you will find a course description along with pedagogical objectives. Under Tasks, you will find a synopsis of the tools needed to partake in programming activities. Tasks and programming challenges will be submitted through GitHub. As such, you are asked to Sign Up for GitHub.com (if needed); this is free. By now, a GitHub invitation was sent to your TAMU account.

Tasks 1 & 2 should be completed by Wednesday, January 16. These two tasks aim at transforming your personal computer into a world-class development station. Luckily, the necessary tools are either available for free, or are made accessible to you through educational licenses. You do NOT need to purchase software for the course.

We may devote part of the session on Tuesday, January 15, to troubleshooting issues.

Good Luck,

Jean-Francois Chamberland
